# Ergodic-DS

This repository is dedicated to exploring ergodic theory concepts in dynamical systems and their applications in data science. It covers topics such as the Koopman operator, Poincar√© recurrence, pointwise ergodicity simulation, sojourn time analysis, mixing properties, Hopf arguments, bifurcations, and more. These concepts are fundamental in understanding the behavior of dynamical systems and analyzing complex data sets.

Key Features:

    Implementation of ergodic theory algorithms and simulations in Python.
    Application of ergodic theory concepts in data science tasks.
    Visualization and analysis of dynamical systems behavior.
